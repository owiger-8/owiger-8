>I'm an AI & Machine Learning student at VIT AP with a focus on building foundational models and systems from the ground up. My current project is a custom 1-billion-parameter, decoder-only LLM for code generation, specifically designed for memory-efficient training on consumer hardware. I work primarily in Python's deep learning ecosystem and am exploring Rust for high-performance, systems-level AI. Always open to connecting with others passionate about the intersection of ML and systems.
